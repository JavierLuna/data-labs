# Analyzing NY Green taxis.

## Description:

In Ironhack we are asked to study the provided to do this project, which is about NYC Green Taxis (also known as Boro Taxis). 

These taxis appeared in 2013. The purpose of this taxis is to improve the transportation in the 5 boroughs of NY, in particular out of Manhattan. Boro Taxis are also aimed to offer a better service for people with disabilities. 

The difference between yellow and green taxis is that green taxis can only pick up passengers from the streets in northern Manhattan (north of West 110th Street and East 96th Street), and anywhere else in the 4 boroughs (except the airport area). However, they can drop off anyone elsewhere in the 5 boroughs (including airports).

The data worked with is from 2018.  


## Limitations:

I couldn’t get the total amount of taxis. 

## Main conclusions: 

•    Verifone has most of ‘Bogos’ taxis market.

•    Most of the payments are made with credit card. 

•    Even though these taxis can in Manhattan pick up only passengers from the streets in northern they are taking services from southern and central Manhattan.

•    The peak days and time of demand are usually Friday’s evening (6-7pm).
