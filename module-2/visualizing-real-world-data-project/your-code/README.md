# Visualizing Real World Data Project

## Overview

This project is going to set basis for the previous learnings that we saw durign the module-2. 

We are going to analise and try to discover interesting outcomes and how to represent them from a Real World dataset.

#### First Step: 

We should download a Real world Dataset, there are numerous website where you can donwload this kind of data. However we have a favourite: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

 #### Second Step:

We need to create or have access to a data environment where we can work properly to be able to manipulate this kind of documents. 

For this specific project the tools that we must use is [Jupyter-Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

You can learn more visiting there web.

Once you have install jupiter you create a file on "Python 3" call "Analysis":

- In this folder we are going to call the dataset
- Create a DATAFRAME
- And manage the differents graph that we are going to use

First you need to do at the beginning of the project is to install and import some libraries that we are going to use:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.plotly as py
import seaborn as sns
from ipywidgets import interact
import cufflinks as cf

%matplotlib inline
cf.go_offline()
```

Wich kind of graph we should represent on the project:

:bar_chart:Bar chart

:chart_with_upwards_trend:Bar line

:world_map:Maps (Scatter)

:sweat:Heat Maps

#### Third Step:

You must create a new file on Jupyter call "Analysis", where we are going to :v:Make a Presentation :v: of the project.

This project will analyse the [Imbd](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home) data set from 2006 to 2016, answering questions like:

- First we must inspect the database to see if is clean and what type of data is in the db.
  - Answer 1

- Whats the average duration of all the movies from the database. 
  - Answer 2

- Which Year is the most successful in terms of Money Vs MetaScore. 
  - Answer 3
- Which movie was the one it make more money that year.
  - Answer 4
- Which of the 4 most famous Directors was the most profitable.
  - Answer 5
- Finally we have an interactive graph where you can see the distribution of Movies by Revenue and MetaScore filtered by Year. 
  - Answer 6

Thanks for the attention and I would like to apologise for any mispelling I could write.
