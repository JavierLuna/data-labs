Her grandson came to visit with his wife on the wedding day, they took pictures. She passed away within a week. Saddest shit.\n\nAnother time I had a young 23 year old pass away from a treatable cancer, the reason he passed was because the cancer had spread to his colon and it caused a perforation. Although chemotherapy would have saved him he still died of complications.\n\nI had to make a 30 year old comfort care ve cause she had been abusing so much heroine all her life. Her mom told me she started when she was 16. The patient had twins.\n\nI had a patient who was 28 and he had a cardiac arrest outside the hospital came to us after resuscitation. Unfortunately had brain death and we had to make him comfort care because there was non reviving him, he had a pregnant gf.\n\nI have many more and some of them I just write down to rmr their stories.\n\nThe saddest one is my clinic patient who I took care of for two years (every couple of months or so) and then she stopped coming and I knew something was off but she was just in and out of the hospital.

TL;DR at bottom.\n\n Senior year of high school, whenever I was sad/lonely, I would drive to the school late at night and climb up on the roof just to hang out. Super emo, I know. When I was watching Gaurdians of the Galaxy in theaters with my mom and dad, my mom got a text from her sister saying that my granddad had passed away. Not surprising, long time coming really. \n\nSo when we finished the movie, we went home and I drove to the school. It was storming pretty heavily, but I didn't mind, I like the rain. So I climbed up on the school and hung out, tried to get some cool pictures of the lightning.\n\nWhile I was getting down, I noticed some movement in the school. I stayed out of sight and saw a bunch of people in moving furniture and desks around in the lobby. Some people came out towards me, going to the fine arts building. I recognized on of their voices so I jumped down from my hiding spot and asked what was up.\n\nThey said it was the senior prank, and asked if I wanted to see what they were doing. Curious, I said sure and walked in. They had fucked up everything. Wrestling mats in the common area, trees where there shouldn't be trees, a whole staircase blocked off by desks. I looked around at all the people and realized that they were all wearing masks. So I said, \"y'all wild\" and left. \n\nNext day I didn't have class cause I dual enrolled so I didn't go to school. My mom called me, told me that our principal had called her asking about what I was doing at the school. She responded with, \"well, idk why but there's a place he likes to go when he's feeling down and his granddad died last night, Soo...\" He was very apologetic and awkwardly hung up.\n\nNext day I get called up to just reaffirm my mom's story. They didn't suspect me cause I was a good kid on most of my teachers good side, but, thought it was funny.\n\nTL;DR Was at the school late at night cause I was sad, senior prank happened to be going down, got caught on security camera, said that my granddad died.",
