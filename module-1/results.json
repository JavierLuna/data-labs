So in an attempt to hurt the other kids feeling that much more, I started making racist comments. Luckily none of the other kids had any idea what racism was, so they weren't all that insulted. The teachers however were shocked, and I got scolded for about 10 minutes, but after that all was well and good again. \nI got off surpisingly easy for making actively recist comments...\nEDIT: I didn't grow up to be racist, I was just angry with those kids",

Awesome. \n\nMom was briefly puzzled but insisted I needed to question her further and find out what I had \"really\" done to her. \n\nThank fuck for my stepdad because he snuck into my room and said, \"I'll deny it if you tell your mother I said this, but beat her ass.\" After all, violence is NEVER the answer!\n\nProtip: Yes, sometimes it is. \n\nCouple of days later sister and I are mailing a letter and here she comes again. She was kicking me, calling me a little pussy bitch, ugly and stupid... and I guess I just decided to try dad's way. \n\nBy the end I had her by the hair, swinging her in a huge arc so she couldn't get at me and she was bleeding and bruised and begging me to stop. I said I would on the condition that she never fucking look, speak or touch me ever again. She agreed. \n\nThen I ran home wailing because I knew my mom was gonna be so mad at me. Even lost a shoe, lol. \n\nLuckily again dad was home. Took him about an hour to figure out I had WON the fight... I still remember the incredulous roar of, \"Wait? What the fuck?? You WON!!? THEN WTF ARE YOU CRYIN ABOUT!!?\"\n\n... and then he found out that the whole time we were fighting, my sister had gone and sat on a fence and watched... and he LOST it. \n\nApparently old school fight rules say that if it's your sibling, you get the fuck in there. Mom was fluttering about in the background yammering on about how disappointed she was, violence is never the answer, blah blah blah and by that point I got to see stepdad put his parenting foot down. \n\nI would NOT be punished for finally dealing with a bully. Mom would shut the fuck up with her hippie nonsense. Twin sister would spend the rest of the night in her room thinking about how fucked up it was she sat on a fence and watched. \n\nLol.",

His wife had an affair with his therapist, who then told her all my dad\u2019s traumas and triggers so she could use them against him.  When she had him at just the right point of breakdown, she took my sister and disappeared.  Just poof, gone, no trace.  My dad looked for her, hired investigators, tried everything.\n\nEight years later, my mom and dad married, and I was born a year after that.  I remember from childhood that there were two pictures of a little girl who looked like me, and I was told it was my sister, but it didn\u2019t mean anything to me because I didn\u2019t understand.  My parents chose to stay in the same town and at the same address no matter what, so that if my sister ever came looking he\u2019d be easily found.  He kept a gift wrapped Kermit the Frog on the top shelf of his closet that had been a present for her third birthday that he never got to give her.\n\nOne morning when I was eight he got a phone call.  He said hello, paused, identified himself by his full name, then went pale.  I remember him saying, \u201cIf this is a joke, it isn\u2019t funny.\u201d  It wasn\u2019t a joke, though, it was my sister.  She was about to graduate high school and had recently learned that her horrible stepfather (the goddamn therapist!) was not her biological father and so had wanted to meet her real family.  We\u2019ve been very close ever since.  She knows now that dad never stopped looking for her, and everything she was told was a lie.  Dad was finally able to give her the Kermit stuffed animal and she has it displayed in her house.\n\nIt\u2019s had a huge impact on all of us.  For a long time my dad was terrified that my sister was going to disappear again, or hate him, and to an extent still worries about it.  My sister had been psychologically and sexually abused by the therapist stepfather and had a hard time trusting for a while.  I did pretty well until my ex-husband and I split up; he knew the story, so one of his tactics was to take our son on two separate occasions and disappear with him.  The first time he was only gone for two weeks, the second time was a month.  That was hell, but it\u2019s over.",
